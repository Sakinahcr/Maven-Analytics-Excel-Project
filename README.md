### 1. Identify top industries by salary and growth rate

From the raw data, to identify the top industries by salary and growth rate, I nested the UNIQUE and SORTBY functions. Then to determine the average salary and growth by the job Industry, I use AVERAGEIFS function.

__Conclusion:_ Law is the top industry with average salary of $93,394.70 and average growth rate of 1.50%_

### 2. Review average job salaries by job titles by Industry 

To list down the average job salaries by job title by industry with dynamic view, I nested FILTER, UNIQUE and SORT functions.

### 3. Visualize the overall salary distribution 

To visualize salary distribution, I use SEQUENCE and FREQUENCY functions.

__Conclusion:_ Most salary are between $60,000.00 to $90,000.00_

### 4. Compare average job salaries across top US cities 

To make the pivot header, I use the TRANSPOSE function in addition to SORT function, so the cities are sorted alphabetically. The top 10 salary in Technology Industry is highlighted in blue by using CONDITIONAL FORMATTING.
